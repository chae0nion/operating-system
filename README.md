# CLI-Based Chat Server and Client Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to implement a **CLI-based chat server and client** under the Linux environment using multithreading or multiprocessing. Multiple users can connect simultaneously, exchange messages, and maintain a stable chat experience by leveraging network communication and concurrency techniques (threads or processes).

## Objectives
- **Enhance Real-Time Communication Technology**
  - Utilize socket programming to build a reliable and efficient real-time chat system.
  
- **Design and Implement Multi-Process Architecture**
  - Develop a multiprocess-based structure for efficient data processing on both servers and clients.
  
- **Ensure Reliable Network Communication**
  - Implement stable communication channels between server and clients using TCP/UDP socket programming.
  - Handle errors and special cases (e.g., connection failures, disconnections) through well-defined exception 

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Messaging**
  - Instant message exchange between multiple users.
  
- **Multithreading/Multiprocessing Support**
  - Concurrent handling of multiple client connections for seamless communication.
  
- **Optional User Authentication**
  - Secure user access with authentication mechanisms.

## Benefits and Practicality
- **Hands-On Network Programming Experience**
  - Strengthen knowledge in socket programming, concurrency, and synchronization techniques through direct implementation.
  
- **Enhanced Concurrency Control Skills**
  - Gain deeper insights into resource management (mutexes, semaphores) and thread management required for stable real-time messaging under heavy loads.
  
- **Scalability**
  - Build a strong foundation for adding features like file transfer, AI chatbots, or additional security layers, ensuring the project can evolve further.
  
- **Educational and Real-World Application**
  - Acquire skills relevant to designing enterprise chat systems or internal messenger solutions, making this project highly valuable for both learning and practical use.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** [Specify Language, e.g., Python, C/C++]
- **Concurrency:** Multithreading
- **Networking:** TCP/UDP Socket Programming
